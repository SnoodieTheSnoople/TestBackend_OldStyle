## What is this project about?

The project being developed is an Online Service Book/Maintenance Book, which is particularly aimed at older vehicles that do not have a digital service menu in the carâ€™s infotainment system/MMI. German manufacturers such as BMW and Audi have digital service books but lack the ability to store maintenance performed on a vehicle.

This idea came from my recent purchase of my E92 BMW. I wanted to keep track of it digitally; however, the main pain that I have is the population of fields on an Excel spreadsheet. Additionally, the Service Book only contains fields related to BMW service items and does not include other maintenance items which is important for the resale of the vehicle. With the OE service book provided by BMW, it does not have any fields that allow the population of any other maintenance such as suspension changes, power steering fluid changes, tyres, battery, etc. Owners will typically keep receipts inside a file and will provide it to a car dealer or will present it to a customer to inspect which will highlight the maintenance. 

The issue with handing receipts or pieces of paper is that it can often be unorganised, and the recipient will have to spend time to understand what maintenance has been performed. As a result, the goal for this project is to combine the service book containing brand specific service items and maintenance items in an accessible site. Not only will text be associated with the service/maintenance item, but pictures and any other form to validate the maintenance will also be provided to ensure it is genuine.


## Development of the Proposed Idea

This project will be developed in two pieces. The first being a prototype of the business logic and will operate as a local console app. The console app will have a rudimentary menu that will allow the viewing, addition, and editing of the service/maintenance book. This will then be used to develop the second stage after completion. The second stage will then include the development of an API, full integration with a database, and the frontend development for accessibility. 

As this is an evolving project, the development may change and will not strictly follow what is proposed as the development; however, it will roughly follow what is stated here.
